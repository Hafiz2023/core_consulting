      eLearning is training provided via a computer or other digital device,
      allowing technology to facilitate learning anytime, anywhere.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The above itself talks about the benefits of eLearning. This medium of
      delivering training is highly cost effective. This is especially good
      when the audience is in large number or the content is repetitive.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Another benefit of deploying eLearning systems is that the
      geographically disbursed audience can be catered to. The eLearning
      module can be integrated with your existing LMS (Learning Management
      System) or can be deployed in standalone mode.
