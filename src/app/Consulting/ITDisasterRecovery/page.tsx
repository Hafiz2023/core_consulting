      description:
        "IT is the backbone of every business. An IT disaster can cause a company-wide disruption. Per Gartner, 2 out of 5 organizations that experience a severe disaster go out of business within five years.\n\nMost organizations are now critically dependent on IT. Disasters can strike at any time without prior notice. When IT fails, organizations may be unable to function. Severe disasters can incapacitate or even permanently cripple a business.\n\nâš  Loss of data can bring the organization to a standstill â€“ not to mention fines, regulatory sanctions, etc.\n\nIT Disaster Recovery is critical for any organization due to regulations and corporate governance implications. ICT continuity management supports overall Business Continuity Management (BCM), ensuring processes are protected and organizations can respond effectively.",
